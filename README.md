# Silent Countdown Timer #

This repository contains a tiny page that will show you a visual alarm when a
certain time has passed. The main feature is that the timer is silent. You 
will get a desktop notification when the alarm goes off instead of a beep.

You can find the timer here: <https://birdfont.org/timer.html>
